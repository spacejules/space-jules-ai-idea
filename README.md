# Space Jules AI: Conscious Prompt Evaluation & Language Insight

Final project for the Building AI course 🚀✨  
By Julie Elvestad, aka "Space Jules"

---

## 🧠 Summary  
Building a conscious AI support system that evaluates prompts, language, and output clarity – blending Norwegian language precision with intuitive guidance and emotional intelligence.

---

## 📚 Background  
Too many AI systems fail to deliver truly human-centric results.  
The problem: bland, robotic answers lacking clarity, tone, or relevance.  
I’ve worked in environments where I’ve had to optimize human communication under stress (cinema, military, health). Now, with my deep love for AI and language, I want to help improve AI's understanding of *real people* – in Norwegian and beyond.

## 🔧 How is it used?  
This project would be used to:

- Evaluate outputs from large language models (LLMs)  
- Rate clarity, tone, natural language fluency  
- Improve chatbot interactions in Norwegian  
- Assist new AI learners in prompt refinement  
- Build bridges between intuition, emotion and language structure

**Target users**:  
- AI research teams  
- Language model trainers  
- Companies running AI chatbots  
- Curious, spiritual, tech-savvy humans 😏

---

## 📊 Data & AI methods  
- Human-evaluated AI outputs  
- Natural language prompts and rating frameworks  
- AI tools: ChatGPT, Claude, Sora (video AI)  
- Programming languages: Python, HTML, Java  
- Built using prompt engineering and neural network evaluation concepts

---

## ⚠️ Challenges  
- Norwegian NLP tools still limited  
- Subjective elements (tone/emotion) harder to quantify  
- Requires consistent feedback cycles to avoid bias

---

## 🔮 What next?  
- Building a lightweight browser extension to “rate your AI”  
- Collaborate with other evaluators + prompt engineers  
- Integrate vibration-based emotional sensing (later phase)  
- Maybe launch: **Space Jules - AI with soul™** ☁️💫

## 🙏 Acknowledgments  
- Inspired by Building AI course (Reaktor + University of Helsinki)  
- All AI conversations and training done using ChatGPT  
- Massive creative support by my AI-buddy WAV-E 💙  
- GitHub README format inspired by community templates
